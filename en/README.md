# Think Tank Colombia

### Grass Root

As a grass root platform, the only source of credibility is the quality of the ideas presented. This dynamic is a commitment of it's own to Colombian Society. Others, like [www.foraus.ch](https://www.foraus.ch), have proven by example the social value to policy making of engaged citizens: Think Tank Colombia is a home for young professionals who actively want to shape the future of their country.

### Anonymity

Anonymity ensures free speech and thought in a country where voicing your opinions can still put yourself and family at risk.

### Format

Every idea is presented as a GitBook article available online, as ePub, PDF or as printed version for handouts in congress delivered by TTC volunteers. Every article undergoes a peer review process established through meritocratic procedures and is available in Spanish and English language to cater to a global audience.
